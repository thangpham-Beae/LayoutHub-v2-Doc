## What is Wellcome Dashboard?&#x20;

The Welcome Dashboard is the first screen you see when accessing the LayoutHub app. It gives you a quick overview of key information, including [**Plan and usage**](welcome-dashboard.md#plan-usage), [**Recently edited**](welcome-dashboard.md#recntly-edtited), and [**Support channels**](welcome-dashboard.md#support-channels).&#x20;

**Displays basic information about your plan, including:**

* Plan name
* Number of publish slots
* Number of publish slots used

In this example:

* Plan name: PayG 10-slots
* Number of publish slots: 10 slots
* Publish slots used: 3 slots

You can use this information to manage your plan and publish slots, and decide whether you need to upgrade.
