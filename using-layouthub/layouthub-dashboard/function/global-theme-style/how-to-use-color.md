# How to use Color?

## Overview

In this article we will guide you to **Color** and **customize Scheme** to have a consistent style in all pages.

## How to use Colors?

By default, Color will have 3 Schemes and 1 option set for Other colors. You can click **Add Scheme** to create your own Scheme.&#x20;

## What's in a Scheme?

The settings of a Scheme include color configurations divided into two parts:&#x20;

1. Section color.
2. Button color.

### 1. Section colors:

The basic colors of a section include: Background, Heading text and Body text.

### **2. Button colors:**

Button color has two states:

**Normal:**

* **Background** – the button’s background color
* **Label** – the text color
* **Outline** – the outline color of the button

**Hover:**

* **Background tone** – adds a color layer on top of the button background
* **Label** – adds a color layer on top of the text
* **Outline** – adds a color layer on top of the outline

Dragging the slider to the left applies a white tone layer, while dragging to the right applies a black tone layer.\
The further you move the slider toward either side, the less transparent the tone layer becomes.

## How to change color in Scheme?

You can change a color using the **color picker** or by entering a **Hex color code**.&#x20;
