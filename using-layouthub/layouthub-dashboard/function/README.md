# Functions

## Overview

In this series, we will introduce you to the LayoutHub Dashboard interface and the features available within it.&#x20;

## What is Functions?

Functions are extra tools and features that you can add to your store to improve the shopping experience and boost performance.\
Each function provides a specific enhancement, for example: showing color swatches, creating a free-shipping bar, adding quick view for products, showing sale notifications, and more.

In the Functions page, you can browse all available features, activate the ones you need, and customize them to fit your store.

Click **Functions** Shopify side bar to access Functions.

**Important Notice: Legacy Items in editor v2.0**

Items marked as Legacy will not be supported in editor v2.0.

If you are currently using the older editor v1.0, your existing setup will continue to work without interruption.

We strongly encourage you to start moving to the new editor v2.0 standards for the best experience, access to new features, and ongoing support.
