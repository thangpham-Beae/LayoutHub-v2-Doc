## What is Functions?

Functions are extra tools and features that you can add to your store to improve the shopping experience and boost performance.\
Each function provides a specific enhancement, for example: showing color swatches, creating a free-shipping bar, adding quick view for products, showing sale notifications, and more.

In the Functions page, you can browse all available features, activate the ones you need, and customize them to fit your store.
