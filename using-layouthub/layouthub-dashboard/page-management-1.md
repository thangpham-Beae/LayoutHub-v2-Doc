#### **When should you use Export/Import?**

1. **Backup for recovery**\
   Export your page and save it on your device as a backup. This ensures you can easily restore the page if anything unexpected happens.
2. **Use the same page on another store**\
   Export a page from Store A and import it into Store B whenever needed.\
   &#xNAN;_(Both stores must be using LayoutHub.)_

### Delete and mange deleted page

If you want to delete a template, you will first need to move the template to the Trash section. If you accidentally delete any pages or sections, you can restore them from Trash within the next 30 days. After this time, they will be deleted forever and there’s no way to retrieve them.
