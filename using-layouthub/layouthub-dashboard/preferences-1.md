#### Frequently Asked Questions

**Why I need to enter my store password?**

If you have a storefront password, you need to enter it in order to see your store's theme in LayoutHub. Don't worry, your store is still password protected.

**How do Editor settings work?**\
These options in Editor settings are for **Legacy Editor version** only.&#x20;

* **Auto sync layout when change theme:** When you changed the theme, The app will automatically sync your layouts to the new theme (It maybe overwrite default template).
* **Reload page after added to cart:** By default, we will redirect to the cart page after you add to the cart, if this option is enabled, it will reload the current page instead of going to the shopping cart page.
* **JQuery:** improve compatibility with animations, events, and dynamic features.

**Why does it show "Incorrect password" even after I changed my password and updated it in Store Settings?**

If you update your password multiple times in a short period, Shopify may temporarily block requests for security reasons. Please wait around **15 minutes**, then try updating the password again.
