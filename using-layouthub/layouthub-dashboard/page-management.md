### 2. Export and Import

Export and Import allow you to save your page to your device and reuse it whenever needed.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Lean more about how to use Export and Import feature in [this article](../../page-and-section-management/export-import.md)**.**
{% endhint %}

**When should you use Export/Import?**

1. **Backup for recovery**\
   Export your page and save it on your device as a backup. This ensures you can easily restore the page if anything unexpected happens.
2. **Use the same page on another store**\
   Export a page from Store A and import it into Store B whenever needed.\
   &#xNAN;_(Both stores must be using LayoutHub.)_

### 5. Delete and mange deleted page

If you want to delete a template, you will first need to move the template to the Trash section.&#x20;

If you accidentally delete any pages or sections, you can restore them from Trash within the next 30 days. **After this time, they will be deleted forever and there’s no way to retrieve them**.

{% hint style="info" %}

### 6. Make a page as default template and restore default template

* **Make a page the default template:** this option sets your LayoutHub page as the main template used for that page type on your store (e.g., Homepage, Product Page). Once applied, customers will see this page when they visit that part of your store.&#x20;
* **Restore default template:** this option switches the page type back to Shopify’s original built-in template. Use it when you want to stop using a LayoutHub page or reset the layout to the default version.

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn more about **Make and Restore Default Templates** in [this article](../../page-and-section-management/make-and-restore-default-templates.md).
{% endhint %}

#### **Example:**&#x20;

&#x20;The product page created with LayoutHub will be set as the default template displayed for all products.

1. Select **Product** in page category.

{% endhint %}

### 7. Track page metrics with page analytics

Page Analytics helps you track how your page performs by showing key metrics such as views, clicks, and user behavior. This feature allows you to understand how visitors interact with your page so you can make better design and content decisions to improve conversions.

To create an analytics campaign for a page, simply **select the page** you want to track and click the **Analytics** button.
