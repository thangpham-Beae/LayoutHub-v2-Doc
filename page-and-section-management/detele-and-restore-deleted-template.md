# Manage and recover deleted items

## Overview

## What is Trash?

The Trash helps you retrieve the pages that you accidentally deleted, and restore them immediately by yourself.

When you delete a page or a section, it will be stored in the Trash. If you accidentally delete any pages or sections, you can restore them from Trash within the next 30 days. After this time, they will be deleted forever and there’s no way to retrieve them.

## How to access Trash?

You can access Trash by clicking Page and selecting Trash.
