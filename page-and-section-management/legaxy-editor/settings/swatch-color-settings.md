Color swatch replace the traditional dropdown for variant options of type color. However, if you are using some color names that are non standard (like "zebra black", or "denim blue" for instance), you will get the color swatch appears white.

This is because the theme can't guess which color to display. To solve this issue, you need to decide your own colors to match their names.&#x20;
