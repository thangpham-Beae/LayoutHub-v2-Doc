Here we use Specific tabs created from headings in the product description so they're perfect for information that isn't shared by multiple products such as ingredients, specifications and materials.

To enable specific tabs please follow the steps bellow:

\+ Go to customize your product page.&#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/product-tab2 (1) (1).png>)

\+ Select the **heading** that you will use as a specific tab. For example I select Heading 4 to make the tab.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/product-tab3 (1).png>)

\+ Save your page.

#### **4.6.2 - Create a specific tab**

Tabs that are specific to a single product are generated from headings that you add into the **product description** content.

To create a specific tab, please follow the steps bellow:

\+  Click **Products** from your Shopify admin menu.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/product-tab3 (1) (1).png>)

\+ Click and drag over the name text to select it.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/product-tab6 (1).png>)

\+ Click the **Formatting** button from the **Description** area toolbar and click **Heading 4** from the formatting dropdown menu. For example I want to make the **TEMPUS CONSECTETUR** and **FIND YOUR SIZE** texts to **H4 tag.**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/product-tab7 (1).png>)

\+ Click on **show HTML** button to check the tags.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/product-tab8 (1).png>)

\+ The content of the title and content should **not contain div, script or main tags**, like this:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/product-tab9 (1).png>)

\+  Click **Save** when done to save the content.

You can repeat the steps above to create as many specific tabs for the product as you'd like. Any **Heading 4** in the description will be converted into a tab and any content below a **Heading 4** will become the content for that tab.

_Finally, reload the product to see the result:_

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/product-tab11 (1).png>)

However, if you are launching a promotion campaign, you would like to allocate a specific value for a specific product. So you can do that by using [Metafields Guru App.](https://apps.shopify.com/metafields-editor-2)

You can refer to this [**link**](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/110057030-using-metafields-in-your-shopify-theme) to understand how to use Metafields.

### Create a Metafield Countdown for a product with input values below

**Key:** `countdown`&#x20;

**Namespace**: `layouthub`&#x20;

**Value:** i.e)`2020/12/12` or `60 days, 3:59:12` or `2019-12-08T16:47:00+0000 12:30`

* Example: 60 days, 3:59:12 or 2019-12-08T16:47:00+0000.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (402).png>)

* If you turn on "**Random countdown to date and time"** option, the timer will display randomly.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (433).png>)

* Besides random option, you can set countdown for each product by [metafield app](https://apps.shopify.com/metafields-editor-2?surface_detail=metafields\&surface_inter_position=1\&surface_intra_position=4\&surface_type=search). You can go refer [HERE](https://docs.layouthub.com/user-guides/add-ons/product-countdown) to know more.
