# Sub-page

The LayoutHub team provides custom content-type modules for you to import and custom. Base on them, you can completely create your own page structure.&#x20;

Block Designs can be used in various different styles and combination depending on the complexity of your page. Ultimately the structure of your page is completely up to you, and will be determined on the design you are trying to achieve.

## 1 - What is a handle?

First, to build a sub page with LayouHub, you have to know what is a **handle**. By default, a handle is the object's title in lowercase with any spaces and special characters replaced by hyphens (-). Most objects in Shopify (products, collections, blogs, articles, menus) have handles.

For example, a page with the title **"About Us"** have  handle `about-us`. Navigate to **Shopify** **Admin > Pages** > **Select a page** to edit > Click **Edit website SEO**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot_6 (2).png>)

You will see the page's handle as shown below: `about-us`

* **Page Title**: Enter the name that is showed in LayoutHub Admin dashboard.
* **Page handle or human url:** type any new handle names there.
* **Meta description:** is a snippet of up to about 155 characters – a tag in HTML – which summarizes a page's content. Search engines show the meta description in search results mostly when the searched-for phrase is within the description, so optimizing the meta description is crucial for on-page SEO.
* **Publish page**: make it live on your store, everyone can see it.
