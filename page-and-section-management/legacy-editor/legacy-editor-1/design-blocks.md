## **How to configure a Block?**

**Layout Hub** gives you two different tabs to edit individual texts and images. While the specific options that you’ll see in each tab depend on the exact texts, images that you’re editing, the general division of options is the same no matter what:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Editing" %}
**Editing:** to change texts, images, colors.

{% endtabs %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Section" %}
**Section:** to change entirely the background, section ID, margin and padding of the section.

{% endtabs %}

Every single one of Block has a **Section tab** to adjust the space and gaps between sections. Directly type a number of pixel (negative number acepted) to the corresponding **Margin values** here as the size of the gaps.
