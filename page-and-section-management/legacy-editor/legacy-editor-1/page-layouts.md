# Create Layouts

## What is a Page Layout?

Page Layout is a **template** that includes pre-built elements such as sections, blocks, texts, images, sliders,... etc. They are combined to each other to construct a spectacular structure in various styles.

We offer **5 types** of **Page template**. They are **Standard, Product, Collection, Blog** and **Article pages.**

Moreover, every Page Layout showcased will have high-quality **free stock images** as placeholders. Our design team has crafted each and every piece of an individual template to ensure it is unique and **easily modified** to adapt to your unique needs.

With LayoutHub, you don’t have to be a developer to create a page. With LayoutHub you don’t have to be designer either.
