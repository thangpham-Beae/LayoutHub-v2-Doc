# Refund

## When can I get a refund?

To make sure that you will satisfy 100% with LayoutHub app, if you are not ready with the purchase yet, we have a **14-Day Money-Back Guarantee.** That mean you can request a refund within **14 days of first activating your paid plan** for any reason.

**For example**: You upgrade to a paid plan on June 15, 2025 and request a refund on June 20, 2025 (still within 14 days). In this case you are fully eligible to request a refund.

## Who will charge me if I sign up for a paid plan?

Shopify manages the app’s payment, and they will charge users when users activate a paid plan of all third party apps. You can prefer more in [Shopify Help Center.](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/manage-billing/your-invoice/apps)

## What happens to my pages if I request a refund?

Requesting a refund from LayoutHub also means that you will cease using LayoutHub paid plans.

* If you decide to downgrade from a higher plan to a lower plan (e.g. PayG-30 to PayG-10 or Enterprise to PayG-10) or downgrade to the Free plan, please check [this article](refund.md#what-happens-to-my-pages-if-i-request-a-refund).&#x20;
* If you decide to cancel your plan, please check [this article](change-your-plan.md#what-happens-if-i-cancel-my-pan).&#x20;

## What do I need to prepare to request a refund?

We need the Shopify bill for the requested billing cycle of your store. Based on that, we will have more clues about the case and detect the issue better. \

You can download the Shopify bill via: **Settings** > **Billing** > Select "**Billing for target period**" > **Download**. Alternatively, you can take **a full screenshot of the bill details page**.
