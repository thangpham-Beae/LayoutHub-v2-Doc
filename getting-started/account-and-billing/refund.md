# Refund policy

## When can I get a refund?

To make sure that you will satisfy 100% with LayoutHub app, if you are not ready with the purchase yet, we have a **14-Day Money-Back Guarantee.** That mean you can request a refund within **14 days of first activating your paid plan** for any reason.

**For example**: You upgrade to a paid plan on June 15, 2025 and request a refund on June 20, 2025 (still within 14 days). In this case you are fully eligible to request a refund.

## Who will charge me if I sign up for a paid plan?

Shopify manages the app’s payment, and they will charge users when users activate a paid plan of all third party apps. You can prefer more in [Shopify Help Center.](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/manage-billing/your-invoice/apps)

## What happens to my pages if I request a refund?

Requesting a refund from LayoutHub also means that you will cease using LayoutHub paid plans.

* If you decide to downgrade from a higher plan to a lower plan (e.g. PayG-30 to PayG-10 or Enterprise to PayG-10) or downgrade to the Free plan, please check [this article](change-your-plan.md).
* If you decide to cancel your plan, please check [this article](change-your-plan.md#what-happens-if-i-cancel-my-pan).

## What do I need to prepare to request a refund?

You will need to **provide a payment confirmation invoice from Shopify**. Please export **the bill containing the LayoutHub payment** and provide it to LayoutHub customer support team for assistance and processing.

We need the Shopify bill for the requested billing cycle of your store. Based on that, we will have more clues about the case and detect the issue better.
