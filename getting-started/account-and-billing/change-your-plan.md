## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is a publish slot?

Publish slots are the number of templates and sections that you can create with LayoutHub and publish to your theme or live page.

### 2. I have many products, collections. Do they consume my publish slots?

Don't worry, a collection or product template can be assigned to all or many different products or collections.&#x20;

For example: if your store has 10 collections, you just need to create 1 collection template and assign it to those 10 collections. All will be counted as 1 publish slot.

#### **3. What happens if I downgrade to a free plan?**

Free plan has only 1 publish slot so the system will ask you to unpublish pages to draft page and leave only 1 published page.
