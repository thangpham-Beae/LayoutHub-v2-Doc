# Customize Shopify Home Page

## 1. Insert block sections from LayoutHub to top or bottom of Shopify's home page

With Basic plan, you can insert some sections from LayoutHub to the top or bottom of your existing home page. For example, I want to insert a block to bottom of my home page. Go to **Standard pages -> Insert a block to exist page -> Insert to bottom:**
